# firefox-quantum-one-tab
A modified version of chrome-one-tab to be compatible with firefox web extensions' new standards  
   
This version works well with firefox version 75.0b3 except for one problem, the "restore all" button is not working 
if you choosed to restore tabs to a new window. Instead you can temporarily fix this by setting "restore all" button 
to restore tabs to the same winodw inside the "Options" page. Sadly there is no way for me to fix this as the js code
is minimized, so lets go with this solution until the author fixes it.
